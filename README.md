Configuration of my system the way I like it.

## Installation

### Clone and run install script

## Required and Optional External Apps

Required and Optional applications which enhance bash, vim, etc.

Required:

    here. Otherwise you'll have to remove or change the env variable
    `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` in `bash/config`.

Optional
- autojump
- coreutils (dircolors)
- universal-ctags

```
sudo apt-get install silversearcher-ag exuberant-ctags coreutils autojump
