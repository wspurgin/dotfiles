## What is this for.....?

I use this directory so that I can add the executables in .git/safe/../../bin to
the path. As you can probably tell, those executables in bin (in the repo's root
directory) will only be added to the path if the .git/safe directory (this one)
is there. It's a nice-and-not-to-hackish way of adding anything in a local
repo's root bin directory to the environment's PATH.
